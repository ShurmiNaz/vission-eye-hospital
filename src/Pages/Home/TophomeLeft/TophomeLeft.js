                              Over the past few years, Bangladesh has emerged as a significant center for medical travel. The nation has received praise for providing healthcare of the same caliber as that found in wealthy countries at a reasonable cost. In Bangladesh, procedures that can cost thousands of dollars and require the same level of precision and safety can be completed for a fourth of the price.
